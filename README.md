# Welcome to the SVGarden

## Growing all the time!

Home grown, handcrafted, public domain scalable vector graphics.

I have found that I really enjoy coding svgs from scratch. As I make more,<br />
I will add them to the garden. Everything in the garden is yours to do with as you please.<br />
I appreciate attribute if you are so inclined, but I dedicate all of the images<br />
in this collection to the Public Domain, so you are not obligated to provide credit.
